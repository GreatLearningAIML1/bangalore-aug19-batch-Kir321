Aside from gathering more instances from the wild that are representative of the distinction task, we want to develop a set of methods that enhance the data we already have. There are many ways to augment existing datasets and produce more robust models. In the image domain, these are done to utilize the full power of the convolutional neural network, which is able to capture translational invariance. This translational invariance is what makes image recognition such a difficult task in the first place.
